### Difference between Classes and IDs?

IDs | CLASSES
------------ | -------------
```<div id="my_first_id"></div>``` | ```<div class="my_first_classes"></div>```
IDs have higher specificity than classes.  | The only way for classes to outmatch IDs is to use the keyword **!important** in CSS
You can only have ONE id of the same name within the same html page.   | You can create multiple classes of the same name with the same html page
