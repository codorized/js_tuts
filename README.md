### Difference between Classes and IDs?

ID: 
```<div id="my_first_id"></div>```
* IDs have higher specificity than classes. 
* You can only have ONE id of the same name within the same html page. 

CLASS:
```<div class="my_first_classes"></div>```
* The only way for classes to outmatch IDs is to use the keyword **!important** in CSS
